# Vintage Story Mod Manager

A profile based mod organiser and manager for Vintage Story.

* Python 3.11
* JSON based data storage (like the game itself)
* UI with PySimpleGUI
* Windows/Linux compatible (in progress, will address with UI)


Very much a Work in Progress.


## Todo:
- [x] Backend Client to communicate with Vintage Story ModDB API
- [x] Profile management - saving, loading, deploying and undeploying profiles
- [ ] Unit tests for each module
- [x] UI in pysimplegui
- [ ] Wire UI logic to backend (Profiles, deployments, add/remove mods, launching VintageStory)
- [ ] Add settings window to let user set profiles/downloads directory, and game path
- [ ] Add status window to show current activity (fetching mod info, downloading mod, etc)
